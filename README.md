## What is this?   
This is a Blazor WASM app that lets users view WKT and GeoJSON.   
I made this app as existing WKT viewer sites couldn't easily add multiple WKTs without just combining WKTs into `GEOMETRY COLLECTION`s. This also adds the ability to name polygons and give them a unique color.    

## How to use it
Enter details in the fields, if you want to add another WKT or GeoJSON beyond the 1 default, click "Add Additional Polygon".  
If you need example WKTs, click "ABOUT" in the top right.
