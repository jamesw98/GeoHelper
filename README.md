## What is this?   
This is a Blazor WASM app that lets users view WKT and GeoJSON.   
I made this app as existing WKT viewer sites couldn't easily add multiple WKTs without just combining WKTs into `GEOMETRY COLLECTION`s. This also adds the ability to name polygons and give them a unique color.    

## Features
* WKT viewer.
* GeoJSON viewer.
* Custom colors per geography.
* View [Uber H3](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) hexes for poylgons.
* Shapefile imports.
* Convert WKT to stringified GeoJSON.
